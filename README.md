# WhizzRecipe - Dietary Recipe Finder

WhizzRecipe is a web application that allows users to find recipes based on available ingredients and dietary preferences. It uses numerous APIs to retrieve recipe specifics, images, and nutritional data. The app allows users to search for ingredients, get recipe recommendations, and browse related images, making it easier to plan meals based on what they have in the kitchen.

## Features:
- Recipe Search by ingredients: Users can search for recipes depending on the ingredients they have.
- Dietary Preference Filters: Supports dietary choices such as vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, and more.
- Nutritional Information: Provides detailed nutritional information on dishes, such as calories, fat, protein, and carbs.
- Recipe photographs: Retrieves recipe images from both Edamam and Spoonacular APIs, but for higher-quality and more visually appealing images, the Unsplash API is used to provide images for a visual preview.
- Multiple Recipe APIs: Combines Edamam, Spoonacular, and Unsplash APIs to improve search results.
